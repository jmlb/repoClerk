```prompt
Implement a random example of a crew of agents.
```


```response
Here is an example of a simple crew of agents, drawn from the provided sources:

*   The example uses the `crewai` framework, specifically demonstrating how to create a basic crew with two agents: a `researcher` and a `writer`.
*   The `researcher` agent is assigned the task of conducting research on the latest advancements in AI in 2024, identifying trends, technologies, and industry impacts. They are expected to compile their findings into a detailed report.
*   The `writer` agent uses the research findings from the `researcher` to create a blog post about the advancements.
*   This example utilizes a sequential process, meaning the tasks are completed one after the other.
*   The `Crew` object is initialized with the agents, tasks, and additional settings.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
import os

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"  # serper.dev API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"

# Loading Tools
search_tool = SerperDevTool()

# Define your agents with roles, goals, tools, and additional attributes
researcher = Agent(
    role='Senior Research Analyst',
    goal='Provide in-depth research and analysis of the AI landscape',
    backstory="An experienced researcher with a passion for uncovering insights.",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=True,
    tools=[search_tool],
    cache=False,  # Disable cache for this agent
)

writer = Agent(
    role='AI Content Writer',
    goal='Craft engaging and informative content about AI',
    backstory="With a deep understanding of the tech industry, you transform complex concepts into compelling narratives.",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=True,
    tools=[search_tool],
    cache=False,  # Disable cache for this agent
)

# Create tasks for your agents
task1 = Task(
    description=(
        "Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the latest advancements in AI in 2024. "
        "Identify key trends, breakthrough technologies, and potential industry impacts. "
        "Compile your findings in a detailed report."
    ),
    expected_output='A detailed report on the latest AI advancements in 2024',
    agent=researcher,
)

task2 = Task(
    description=(
        "Craft a captivating blog post based on the provided research report. "
        "Highlight the most significant AI advancements, their implications, and future potential. "
        "Ensure the post is engaging, informative, and accessible to a broad audience."
    ),
    expected_output='A compelling 3 paragraphs blog post formatted as markdown about the latest AI advancements in 2024',
    agent=writer,
    context=[task1]  # Pass the output of task1 as context for task2
)

# Instantiate your crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    verbose=True,
    memory=True,
    planning=True  # Enable planning feature for the crew
)

# Get your crew to work!
result = crew.kickoff()
print("######################")
print(result)
```

This example showcases the fundamental structure of creating a simple crew using the `crewai` framework. By defining roles, goals, and tasks for each agent, and configuring the `Crew` object, you can establish a basic multi-agent system for task automation.
